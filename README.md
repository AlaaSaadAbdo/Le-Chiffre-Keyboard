# Le Chiffre (ironically, "the number" in French)
The purpose of the board is to provide a platform for MX and Choc ergo (Alps support too!) in one package for when ones wrists need a break. The board supports an RGB LED strip with DI on port F0. The board is also fitted with support for run-of-the-mill .91" OLED and EC11 rotary encoder.

Great thanks goes to Jake at P3D for really making the case amazing and open sourcing his work. Check him out at P3Dstore.com
